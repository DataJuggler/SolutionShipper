Version 1.0 - Initial Release

-- Bug fixes for second release
Version 1.0.1
Modified the AddTimeStamp method to make every use two digits. 
This ensures all dates are truly unique. It was unlikely a problem would have occurred 
with the old method but I think it was possible with one digit values.

Version 1.0.2
Modified the Clear method to have an optional value for justStatus. 
If justStatus is true then the top portion of the MainForm object is not cleared.
